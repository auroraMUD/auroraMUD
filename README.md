## Ideas for Aurora mud.

I'll divide it into a few categories. 
 * Economic/industrial, demographics, 
* design/research, 
* and military, 
though I'll touch on the last one the least.

### Economic/Industrial

This is what will power your empire. This involves factories, refinaries, etc. Before I go in detail I should discuss some of the basics first.

#### Currency

I think there should be a basic, universal currency that facilitates global trade. Of course, every empire would have their own currency if they wanted to, but the universal currency would be the fundimental currency of the game, and all other currencies would be linked to it. I don't think it should be called credit. Literally every mud has a currency called credit, we should come up with something new. 

#### Materials

There should be core materials required for construction, refining, etc. 

There should be a material similar to steel. For placeholder's sake, we'll call this duranium just like aurora. I think where duranium in this game will differ from aurora is though, there's raw extract duranium, and then processed duranium. So you have to process the duranium before you can use it to build ships and other things. Consider raw duranium akin to iron, while refined duranium would be steel. 

There should be a resource akin to oil, again, we'll call this sorium, just like aurora. It can be extracted from the ground, and gas clouds. Still, raw sorium can be refined into a great deal of resources, just like raw crude can be. Ship fuel, industrial fuel which I'll get to, and other things

There should be a resource similar to copper that's used in the construction of circuits and conducting. So you'd use this in power plants, infrastructure, computers, etc. 

Glass should be a material forged from silicone. It's used in the construction of ships, buildings, and everything with a screen basically. 

Concrete should be a material

There should be a material similar to rubber, but not rubber. This material would be a wonder material of sorts. Being able to insulate wiring, and heat. Be stretchable but strong, and capable of maintaining it's strength for extended periods of times. This material would be used for belts, pullies, wiring, etc
